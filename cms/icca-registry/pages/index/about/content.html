    lets you discover the protected areas of the world through exploring the
    maps and intuitive searching, feeding you information from the <b class="article__bold-text">WDPA</b>, photos from

  <h2 class="article__title article__title--paragraph">Our history </h2>
  <p class="article__paragraph">
    ProtectedPlanet.net is the new face of the World Database on Protected
    Areas (WDPA). Its humble beginnings started 30 years ago as the United
    Nations global list of national parks and has evolved into the only global,
    spatially referenced information source on parks and protected areas. We
    have created ProtectedPlanet.net not only to showcase this wealth of
    information, but also give tools to willing ‘citizen scientists’ who can
    feed their knowledge about protected areas into the WDPA.
