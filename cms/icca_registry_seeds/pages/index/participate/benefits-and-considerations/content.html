<p class="bigger">If you and your community are uncertain about whether to participate, we offer some further information below about what benefits you might expect, and some considerations to take into account before deciding to register. <strong>Participation is </strong><b><strong>voluntary</strong></b> so no community should feel obliged to contribute.</p><h1>Benefits of registering for communities<br></h1><ul> <li><span class="s2">Registration may contribute to <b>security, ownership, and potential legal status</b> of land and resources.</span></li> <li><span class="s2">Discussing and documenting an ICCA can <b>strengthen community ties</b> and help communities to appreciate the multiple values of their ICCAs.</span></li> <li><span class="s2">Registration supports <b>communication</b> within the community and between generations, potentially helping to <b>preserve traditions</b> and <b>encourage participation</b> of youth.</span></li> <li><span class="s2">Case studies provide the opportunity to showcase an ICCA and its achievements, history and challenges to an international audience. </span><span>Information and traditional knowledge that may otherwise be threatened can be stored online and protected.</span></li></ul><h1>Benefits of the ICCA Registry for the wider world</h1><ul> <li><span class="s2">Contributes to a <b>growing body of knowledge</b> that can inform conservation and other policies regarding the positive influence of community-based environmental management and governance.</span></li> <li><span class="s2">Enhances documentation of ICCA sites and systems.</span></li> <li><span class="s2">Creates a global network of ICCAs, allowing communities to learn from one another and appreciate their position within a <b>global community</b> of similar initiatives. </span></li> <li><span class="s2">Provides clarity on progress towards international <b>conservation targets</b>.</span></li></ul><h1>Considerations</h1><p>Although safeguards are included in the Registry, it is difficult to predict all potential issues resulting from participation. The following are some things to consider before registering:</p> <ul> <li>Information on ICCAs, including their location can be <b>viewed <a href="/en/explore" target="_blank">on the case study pages</a> by anyone</b>. This is not the case if the community chooses not to submit a case study. </li> <li>Some communities who are working with economically <b>valuable resources </b>(e.g. species vulnerable to poaching) may not wish to incorporate these into a geo-referenced map.</li> <li>Exposing the location of some vulnerable communities on the internet may open them to <b>unwanted or increased attention</b>.</li> <li>Communities undertaking the processes of registering their ICCA could spark <b>conflict of interest</b> with neighbouring communities or other stakeholders (e.g. private sector/governments/ NGOs/ military etc.)</li> <li>The Registry <b>cannot assist communities</b> with local or immediate threats to their area, such as boundary disputes with other communities or national entities, or extractive activity by multinational companies.</li> <li>Conflicts within the community may become more serious when the value of the decisions become more obvious. Communities may need to strengthen their own immediate relationships first.</li> <li>Governments may not accept/support the process.</li> </ul> <p><span>If you have any concerns or questions, please </span><b><a href="/en/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a></b><span> to discuss your participation.</span></p>
