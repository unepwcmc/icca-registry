	<strong>Note:</strong> while we encourage interested communities to participate, we want to ensure the <strong>benefits and considerations</strong> of participating in the Registry are clearly understood.

<p class="bigger">
	All information in the Registry is treated with respect and discretion. It is managed in adherence with the principles of the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
</p><p>
	There are 
	<strong>two ways</strong> to participate. Full registration includes completing at least part 1, and allows ICCAs to be included in global counts.
</p><ol>
	<li><strong>Register your ICCA in the ICCA Registry </strong><strong><strong>database</strong>. </strong><br>
	Download and complete the questionnaire and data contributor agreement (see links to download on this page) and return to <span class="s4"><a href="mailto:iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org">iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org</a></span><br><br><span class="s3" style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;"><strong></strong></span></li>
	<li><strong>Create a <strong>Case Study</strong> for the ICCA Registry website</strong><br>
	An ICCA case study can be submitted without going through the process of registering, or it can be part of the full registration process of an ICCA. A case study can provide 
	<strong>greater visibility</strong> to communities who wish to share their experiences on the internet. Please see the 'Explore' page for examples</li>
