<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Froxán Common
Woodlands are a community land of 100 hectares (1 km2) that is cared for
directly by the families that live in this village of the Galician municipality
of Lousame, tracing their common roots centuries back. In spite of the
influence of invasive species, the community's territory includes several
priority natural habitats under the EU Habitats Directive (including Alluvial
forests with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Alnus glutinosa</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fraxinus excelsior</i>, Temperate Atlantic
wet heaths with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Erica ciliaris</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Erica tetralix</i> and Arborescent matorral
with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Laurus nobilis</i>) and other
natural habitats such as Galicio-Portuguese oak woods with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Quercus robur</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Quercus
pyrenaica</i>, and caves with numerous bat colonies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Since 1977, the Froxán
Commons has been recognized as a '<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">monte
veciñal en man común' </i>('common hand community land'). This is a
consuetudinary land ownership status, recognized in Galician and Spanish law. The
common land tenure in Froxán can be traced back to medieval and modern manorial
charters, issued in 1409, 1527 and 1709, defining the boundaries of community
lands and the manorial obligations, although both the institution of Galician
common land and the occupation of what today is Froxán predate Roman invasions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The inhabitants of
Froxán collectively extinguished the manorial ties in 1928, buying off the
lands for the sum of 6.049 pesetas. However, this 'manorial redemption' agreement
was not respected by the State, which took hold of the common lands,
incorporating them into the Public Woodlands Catalogue in the 1930s and 1940s.
This severely restricted traditional rights of use, and in particular communal silvo-pastoralism
(a complementary combination of land-uses, integrating trees and livestock
grazing). Lands were handed over to mining companies, which held concessions
over the community territory, and to the State Forestry Service, which
established its own plantations prohibiting silvo-pastoralist practices and
imposing heavy fines on the commoners. Mining activities resulted in severe
environmental degradation and land disputes that continue today. Invasive
forest species, including Acacia and Eucalyptus, were introduced during the
same period, and important habitats such a peat wetland were damaged by forced drainage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Across Galicia, social
pressure against forced reforestation programmes led to the legal recognition
in 1968 of 'common hand' community lands. On April 14 1975, seven months before
the death of the Dictator Franco, the entire Froxán community signed a petition
to the Civil Governor demanding the devolution of common lands. This occurred
in defiance of the Municipality, which legally held the property at the time.
In 1977, the Froxán Common Woodlands were formally recognized, and the
community gained legal status soon after. Direct assembly governance was
established, with one representative of each house making up the collective assembly
body. Commoner status is not dependent on property ownership or inheritance,
but on effective residency and participation in the village community and
collective decision-making. In 2002, the last remaining ties with the Public
Administration were broken, finalizing the Forestry Contract that had been
inherited from the dictatorship period, and gaining full self-governance of the
community lands.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Faced with degradation
from mining, the community commenced restoration efforts in the 1990s, and
these continue to the present day. Initially, the restoration efforts included
filling in abandoned mine pits and shafts. More recently, efforts have been
initiated to eradicate exotic invasive species (particularly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acacia melanoxylon</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Acacia dealbata</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Robinia
pseudoacacia</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Eucalyptus sp</i>.)
that are aggressively expansive and tolerant of fire. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Eucalyptus</i> plantations are also being removed, as the last
productive cycle gives way to restoration with high-ecological-value native
species. Work has also commenced to restore a wetland that was degraded by State
forest services through drainage and forced forestation. A management plan for
the wetland was selected in 2018 as one of four pilot case studies of climate
change adaptation of natural management initiatives. The community collectively
self-manages its own water supply system, and wetland restoration in the face
of a new pattern of prolonged droughts is perceived as critical to hydrological
regulation. This is particularly important because natural springs from which
water is collected are immediately downhill from the area being restored (see Campo de Lamas Wetland Management Plan (under Resources)<span id="selection-marker-1"

Community has been active in engaging the wider society in its conservation and
restoration efforts, particularly working with children, schools, families and
environmental organizations. These groups have assisted in reclaiming degraded
areas affected by mining activity and invasive species, through participatory
reforestation with native species. Through these activities, the community is
developing an ongoing programme for education and sustainability (“<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Montescola</i>”), showcasing the potential
of community land-management in addressing pressing environmental and social
issues. These issues include climate change, wildfires, invasive species, land
and water contamination and degradation, alternatives to rural depopulation,
and cultural continuity among traditional rural communities in Galicia. These
efforts were recognized in 2017 with the inclusion of Froxán in the ICCA
Registry, being among the first two Community Areas in Spain to participate in
the ICCA Registry. Froxán was simultaneously included in the World Database on
Protected Areas (WDPA) after going through a national peer-review process.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The Froxán Commons has
also promoted a participatory biodiversity inventory (see related links) and
the whole area has been included as a Special Scenic Interest Site (LEIP) in
the Galician Landscape Catalogue. In addition to natural heritage, the common
lands hold significant cultural heritage that evidences a long history of
communal management. This includes a large stone enclosure that has been dated
to the Early Middle Ages, which would hold the community's herds in the higher
part of the mountain. Another feature is a traditional water mill that was
documented in a 1563 notarial deed. Oral memory testifies to the existence of a
megalithic burial mound called 'Casa Vella' ('Old House') that was likely
destroyed by mining in the mid-20th century, and similar megalithic sites are
present in the area. An ancient pathway (‘Caminho da Missa’), which has been
identified as a possible secondary route of the Roman Via XX 'Per loca
maritima', also goes through the common <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Castanea
sativa</i> forest, preserved by the modern road that replaced it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker">Updated 17th October 2018. </span></span></p><p><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-2" class="redactor-selection-marker"><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></p>
