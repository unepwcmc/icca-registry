<h1>What information does the Registry contain?</h1><p>The two main types of information stored in the database are: </p> <ul> <li><b>Descriptive information</b>, including details about the communities or peoples involved, how the area is governed and managed, its history and the habitats it conserves</li> <li><b>Spatial information</b>, including the size, location and boundaries of the area</li> </ul> <p>If a community opts to submit a case study for the website, then <b>multimedia data</b>, such as photos and videos, are also stored and displayed on the <strong><a href="/en/explore" target="_blank"><span class="s3"><b>case study</b></span> pages</a></strong>.</p><hr><h1>Who will be able to access data in the Registry?</h1><p>All case studies submitted to the Registry are <b>available to the public</b> through the interactive map and <span class="s3"><b><a href="/en/explore">case study</a></b></span> pages. Anyone can view this information. All other data contained within the Registry database (i.e., submitted via the registration questionnaire) are <b>not accessible</b> to the general public. </p><p>The Registry may become fully online in the future. In this case, information belonging to communities who have not consented to their information being public will <b>remain offline</b>. This can be specified at the point of registration. </p><p>Communities can choose to have an <b>additional online presence</b> by submitting their data to <span class="s3"><b><a href="http://protectedplanet.net" target="_blank">Protected Planet</a></b></span> in addition to, or instead of, the ICCA Registry. </p><hr><h1>How do I submit information about an ICCA to the Registry?</h1><p>To formally register you need to complete and submit a <b><a href="/en/participate/participate-in-the-icca-registry">questionnaire and data contributor agreement</a></b>. The case study template is not a requirement of registration, but can be submitted if the community wishes to have a presence on the ICCA Registry website. </p><p>Use the <span class="s3"><b><a href="/en/participate" target="_blank">Participate page</a></b></span> to submit information. Download and complete the forms and then submit them to <a href="mailto:iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org"><span class="s4">iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org</span></a>. </p><hr><h1>What is the difference between submitting information to the ICCA Registry and Protected Planet?</h1><p>The ICCA Registry database contains the same descriptive information as Protected Planet, plus additional information on aspects such as history and details about the community. Protected Planet is a spatial database, available <b><a href="http://protectedplanet.net/" target="_blank">online</a></b>, that shows the boundaries of ICCAs alongside other kinds of protected areas. It also stores basic descriptive information, such as site name, governance type and management authority. The ICCA Registry is offline and stores <b>more detailed</b> information on ICCAs, including their history, biodiversity, and information about the communities involved. The two databases are <b>linked</b>, and an <b>ICCA can be listed in one or both</b>. </p><p>Protected Planet is used to assess spatial aspects of the world's protected area system, such as coverage and connectivity. This includes measuring the contributions of ICCAs to conservation around the world. The ICCA Registry supplements this information by storing details on the indigenous peoples and communities that govern ICCAs, their motivations for doing so, the biodiversity they protect, and their history. </p><p>A spatial boundary or point location is needed for inclusion in Protected Planet. Only a point location is necessary for inclusion in the ICCA Registry. An ICCA can be included one or both of the databases. Communities who do not wish their information to be publicly available may prefer to provide information to the ICCA Registry. </p><hr><h1>What is the ICCA Consortium?</h1><p>The ICCA Consortium is responsible, along with other reputable organisations, for <b>peer-reviewing</b> information submitted to the ICCA Registry, subject to the wishes of the community submitting the information. The Consortium was formed during the 2008 World Conservation Congress by several small Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and organizations representing indigenous peoples and community constituencies with years of experience working on ICCA issues. The group developed a broad programme to <b>promote the recognition and appropriate support</b> of ICCAs at national and international levels. <a href="http://www.iccaconsortium.org/" target="_blank"><span class="s3"><b>More details</b></span>.</a> </p><hr><h1>Why can't I find information for ICCAs in certain countries?</h1><p>Because the ICCA Registry grows on a site-by-site basis, there are not yet case study examples for all countries or territories that have ICCAs. New contributions on ICCAs in any country are welcome at any time. To submit information about an ICCA, please visit the <a href="/en/participate" target="_blank">participate</a> page.</p><p><br></p>
